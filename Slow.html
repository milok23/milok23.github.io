									<p>The area started to slowly decline in the early 1900s, and by the 1920s, most of the houses had been turned into boarding houses. It was a transition period
										from single-family homes occupied by white-collar professionals to apartments counting blue-collar workers. In 1920 the homes were still usually occupied by a family,
										but several of the rooms were being rented to loggers.</p>
									<p>The change can best be seen with US census records. Using 311 Penn as an example, based on the US census in 1900, the house was occupied by Horace W Johnston, a salesman, and his family, along with one servant. In 1920 it was occupied by Henry Young, an engineer and his family, but they had no servants and instead rented out some of their rooms to six lodgers. Finally, by 1940 the house had been transformed into an apartment and was being rented out by three families and four individuals. A similar pattern is repeated with the other houses on the block. Additionally, there was a shift from the houses being owned by its inhabitants to almost entirely rented out.</p>
									<p>By 1940 nearly all of the houses were turned into full-fledged apartments. The residents also became much more fluid, often only showing up in the records for a year or two, unlike the earlier families who lived in the same house for years or even decades. This increase in migrant workers also resulted in a lot more individuals and small families living on the block compared to the large multi-generational families originally living there. There was also a shift in the demographics. Through the 1910s, the area was exclusively white and US-born. But by 1940, there were many immigrant families living in the apartment, especially Germans, Irish, Italians, and Puerto Ricans, as well as several African Americans.</p>
