									<p>The first records of development in the area that is currently home to Rutgers Camden began in the 1860. The area was primarily residential with many large rowhouses. Although there were also a few businesses and public buildings, most notably the North Baptist Church, easily spottable due to its large dome. In its early years, the area was quite well off, housing many white-collar professionals and their extended families. A majority of the row houses were large three-story single-family homes, with usually between 8 and 14 rooms, according to newspaper listings. Throughout the US Census, it is possible to determine that the families usually owned their home and occupied it entirely themselves save for a servant or two. This shows that they were well off as they were able to afford an entire three-story row house all to themselves as well as hiring several servants. Some of the common professions were Lawyers, Physicians, and various business professionals.</p>
									<p>Some notable early residents include; Leander W Goldy of 309 Penn, the Vice president of Anderson Preserving Co, who died of apoplexy in 1907. William S Casselman of 317 Penn, a Lawyer and President of the West Jersey Title and Trust Company. His sons, who also lived in the house, were also highly successful, William Jr a second officer in the merchant marine, Mark a Camden attorney, Arthur a physician, and Paul a Marine Engineer . Dr. Fredric W Marcy of 331 Penn, a prominent Camden physician and staff member of the Cooper Hospital. He served in the Medical Corps of the US Army in WW1; after his discharge, he continued to practice in Camden until his death at age 62 in 1928 of a heart attack.</p>
									<p>This was during a time of a big economic boom in Camden with the city growing rapidly. Between 1870 and 1920 Camden's population grew by nearly 100,000. The big driver of this growth and wealth was industry with companies like the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor), Campbell's Soup, New York Shipbuilding Corporation, as well as many others. RCA Victor (Founded	1901) was especially important to this specific area with its factories and offices only a short walk away, some of which remain standing to this day.</p>
