									<p>On July 1, 1950 Rutgers officially took over control of the South Jersey Law School and College of South Jersey forming Rutgers Camden. At the time the college only encompassed six buildings. But the student population grew rapidly during the 1950s along with rapidly expanding program offerings. Enrollment had risen from 201 undergraduates in 1950-1951 to 495 in 1959-60. There were only 31 courses offered to the students that first year, compared to 162 courses by the end of the fifties.
										The first large improvement was the construction of a $350,000 library along Penn Street, between Fourth and Fifth Streets, which opened in September 1957. But aside from the new library the university was still limited to 16 converted row homes. To solve the serious space constraints Rutgers proposed the demolition of several supposedly blighted city blocks and the creation of an entirely new campus. A major move towards this was in November 1959 with the passage of a college bond issue which provided $2.6 million for new Camden Campus construction. This proposal had the support of the city as the area was increasingly seen as a problem and in need of revitalization.
									</p>
									<p>For the city, this urban renewal project was viewed as an easy way to get rid of a problem area. City leaders said Rutgers expansion was economical and highly desirable for the city. Henry J Andreas, the director of the Bureau of Planning and Development, said that "the proposal can be advantageous for the university and the city" and that he "looks forward to cooperating in its accomplishment." The city believed the project would bring in additional tax revenue and serve to revitalize the district.</p>
									<p>Despite all of this support from the city there was significant opposition from the residents of the affected area. Many felt that the area was still salvageable and not as bad as the city said. In an article on the supposed blight issue, many residents objected. Harry Marshal of 413 Penn St. said, "I bought my home from a former county prosecutor, and it is far from a blighted area. Some people have moved in, won't work, have lost all respect for themselves, and are on relief. Municipal officials helped put them there" . Other residents raised similar concerns as well as the issue of finding housing they could afford once they were displaced. In response, the residents filed a  lawsuit against both the City of Camden and Rutgers. Despite this opposition the residents were unable to stop the project from going forward and eventually all of the houses with the exception of the mansion were demolished. </p>
