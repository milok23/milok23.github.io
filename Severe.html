										<h1>Severe Decline, Crime and Blight </h1>

									<p>A significant change that occurred as the area declined was the sharp rise in crime. Crime slowly began to rise in the 1920s and 1930s. However, it really took off in the late 1940s and 1950s. The newspapers became filled with crimes like burglaries, robberies, auto theft, muggings, and occasional violent crimes like assaults and stabbings. The crime only exacerbated the existing issues and resulted in white flight from this area to the suburbs. One example is Frank Bode of 313 Penn, who moved to Runnemede, NJ. In an article on Blight from the Courier-Post in 1961, he said, "I moved to the suburbs because of lack of police protection, and I have two small children.". The flight of the well of residents to the suburbs virtually sealed the fate of the neighborhood.</p>
									<p>By this point in time, the area was in dire straits with rampant crime and derelict housing. The city began taking action over the poor housing and living conditions on the block. Houses were declared unfit to live in; one example was 323 Penn in 1959. The city fined the owner for unsanitary conditions and declared the house unfit for human habitation due to roaches, paint, and plaster falling off the walls and a general state of disrepair. It was the home of two-year-old Antionette Lowe, who died of lead poisoning at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia after eating bits of fallen paint. Similar conditions existed in other homes on the block, with 325 Penn also listed as in violation of city ordinances at the same time.</p>
